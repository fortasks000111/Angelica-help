Angelica chooses the company she wants to work for when she graduates from university; but she can't decide on the size of the future company in any way: "Should we consider mainly small startups or megacorporations?" Yesterday she read in a magazine that the number of employees in companies can be well approximated by a lognormal distribution, i.e. such a distribution of a random variable, the logarithm of which is distributed abnormally. Angelica asks you to help her with her choice and write an Android application that will generate another random number obeying the lognormal distribution law and display it in a text field. She wants to set the parameters μ and σ2 herself directly in the application.
